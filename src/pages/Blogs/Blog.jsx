                    <br />
                    The Context API can be used when you need to manage global state or share data between components in your React application, such as themes, authentication state, language settings, configurations, or as an alternative to Redux for small-scale applications. However, it's important to carefully consider your application's state management needs and architecture before deciding to use the Context API, as other solutions such as local component state, prop drilling, or Redux might be more appropriate depending on your specific use case.

                        <br />
                        Using custom hooks can help you abstract and encapsulate complex logic or behavior, making your components more focused and easier to understand. Custom hooks also promote code reuse, reduce duplication, and improve maintainability, making them a powerful tool for building scalable and maintainable React applications.

                        <br />
                        useRef is a powerful hook in React that allows you to create mutable references to DOM elements or store mutable data that persists across renders without triggering re-renders. It is commonly used for accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly, storing mutable data, or managing values that need to be preserved between renders.

                        <br />
                        useMemo is a powerful optimization tool in React that allows you to memoize the result of a function call and cache it, preventing unnecessary recalculations or re-renders. It is commonly used for optimizing performance, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, and caching API responses or other asynchronous operations.
